This repository contains the codes developed during my stay at the Royal Military Academy, Brussels, related with the project ANDORRA.

One can find here:
- the analysis of the shock waves in the frequency domain in "Fourier_Transform"
- the analysis of the hammer calibration experiments in "Hammer"
- plots of the different sessions in "plot"
- the analysis of the momentum using the impulse in "force-impulse-energy_impact" and "momentum-calibre"
